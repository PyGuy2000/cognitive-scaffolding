name: Transformer Architecture
category: machine_learning
complexity: advanced
description: A neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data
key_components:
  - self_attention
  - multi_head_attention
  - positional_encoding
  - feed_forward_networks
  - layer_normalization
prerequisites:
  - neural_networks
  - linear_algebra
  - sequence_modeling
applications:
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Machine Translation
  - Text Generation
  - Computer Vision
common_misconceptions:
  - "Transformers are only for text"
  - "Attention is the same as focusing"
  - "Bigger is always better"
teaching_hints:
  - Start with the attention mechanism
  - Use visual diagrams
  - Compare to human reading comprehension
  - Show concrete examples
